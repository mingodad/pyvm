List of toplevel pyvm applications
==================================

All these apps accept the `--help` command-line option for more info.
Most graphical apps can be terminated with <ESC>

pyvm windows
	start the pyvm windowing environment. From within that some of the other
	applications mentioned here can be started from the "Start" menu.
	More useful when running pyvm-on-linuxfb backend.

pyvm www <URL>
	Web browser / advanced web bot.
	Currently, the web browser is supposed to work flawlessly in the plain
	HTML mode. There is a CSS rendering engine but because of reasons
	mentioned in the www/README, this rendering engine is considered broken
	and a new one is under construction. Switching to CSS mode may work
	for some sites and may be completely crap for others.

pyvm pdf <PDF-FILE>
	PDF reader.  For PDFs created with TeX and other simple producers
	the result is pretty good.  For ones created with latest versions
	of Adobe PDF Creator, things are a bit messed up but still rather
	readable.  Embeded images work.  Drawing operations are mostly
	broken.

pyvm show <IMAGE>|<DIR>
	show an image

pyvm xterm
	terminal application. more useful for the windowing environment
	but also works in X.

applications that require ffmpeg
--------------------------------

pyvm avplay <VIDEO-FILE>
	video player.  see the file ffmpeg.txt for information to install ffmpeg.

pyvm mp3 <MP3-FILES>
	audio player (text mode).

pyvm soundlab <MP3-FILE>
	this is a graphical audio player with the ability to chop
	an mp3 into smaller chunks. 

pyvm rec
	Record from the mic-in to an mp3.  You can connect vinyl or
	a radio cable there

pyvm CD
	rip an audio CD to mp3 (basically requires lame or bladeenc)
	Can also mount the cd into the filesystem with FUSE and
	use 'pyvm wav -r' to play the tracks.

other

	bittorrent client
pyvm torfs
	mount downloaded torrents into the filesystem

pyvm git [diff|init-db|checkin|checkout|...]

	See GIT.txt for more
pyvm gitex

pyvm youtube <video_id>

pyvm gpg [--verify|--sign|...]
	OpenPGP implementation.  Can be used to sign or verify files

	for now.

pyvm freecell
pyvm mahjongg

pyvm sysconfig
	Inspect/modify global system parameters like the graphical
	backend, networking, etc.  See the file lib/sysconfig.pe
	for more.

pyvm mandelbrot
	a fractal explorer.  This little program, except from the
	fun, is used to demonstrate how combining python code with
	C code results in very fast code nicely.


some smaller ones include
-------------------------

pyvm:
	bell, df, captcha, disasm, fontdump, getrfc, loadavg, pegrep,
	try, transcode, mms, ftp, cptree, wav, ip2country, dns, diff,
	diffstat, bundle, encfile, tar, time, md5, sha, procps, mime


There are several other toplevel "applications" which are either
useful for development, too small, alias-like or too silly to
mention.
Generally, any file in the Lib/ tree can be run with "pyvm name".
Some do something, others test their correct operation and others
are just libraries.
Feel free to add any new application you find useful or exciting!
