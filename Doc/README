The documentation of pyvm is not very good at this moment.
One reason for that is that because the project does not have
fixed APIs and is constantly changing due to non backwards
compatibility, some things were left undocumented.

Since it is a very dynamic evolving toolchain, the documentation
should also be more "dynamic".  The goal is to eventually
explain everything as the code evolves.

In the meantime, as a hacker, you may get stuck even when
trying to do something simple.  For example, there are some
things that the VM does not do properly and should be avoided
because their behavior is unstable, undefined or even crashes,
and there is usually a better way to do the same thing.
The problem is that you don't know which these things are!
