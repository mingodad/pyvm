These are some fonts named, for example "SUSESans-Roman.ttf" from an older
suse distro which are used by mozilla over here.  For testing/comparing
against moz. if you have suse you can try copying them here.

They don't have international characters (moz uses zapfdingbats!) so they
are good only for css testing.
