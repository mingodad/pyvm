Download the corefonts either from:

	http://corefonts.sourceforge.net

or from

	http://students.ceid.upatras.gr/~sxanth/corefonts/

For the latter, just get the files arial32.exe, courie32.exe, times32.exe
plus the cabextract program. extract the files like
	Arial.TTF
and copy them into this directory.

Since the css spec permits absolute metrics as well as metrics relative
to the fonts, and many web designers make their pages with trial and error,
and the css spec does not define the fonts metrics, it is not possible
to implement a conforming browser without the correct fonts.

It's believed that the Microsoft EULA that covers the corefonts is
not evil. Just like an open source developer, microsoft does not want:
	- others taking their code and claiming its theirs
	- others taking their code, modifying it (possibly adding a trojan)
	  and claiming it's microsoft's code.
	- others taking their code and making a profit out of it
	  (GPL may permit this, but it's not nice)

So, given the above interpretation, it will be probably OK to distribute
the corefonts in a future pyvm distribution, under the spirit of good
faith and interoperability for the web.

A tarball that includes the corefonts will not be able to be included
in distributions that are for sale. pyvm by its own is not a product.

We'll see.
