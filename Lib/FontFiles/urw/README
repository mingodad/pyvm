The URW fonts can be used as the "Builtin PDF Fonts".  According to the PDF spec, documents
can define their own fonts (and usually do), but there is a set of builtin ones.

These are the fonts xpdf uses, too.  Only the ones required for PDF are included here.
There are more URW fonts which we may include in the future (look into /usr/share/ghostscript/fonts)

Outside PDF, these fonts *can* be used for the gui (widgets, buttons, menus, lists) and
the web browser (although their metrics differ from the "webfonts" and css may appear
broken).

They are pretty nice but because they are old, type1 fonts, they start to look ugly
in low resolutions (low DPI).  Generally, they were designed for laser printers that
have DPI then times better than computer screens.  On high resolution graphics,
the URW fonts can be used everywhere successfuly.
