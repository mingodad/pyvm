Except from the 8x16 bitmap fonts, the choices for nice scallable fonts are:

	- Builtin PDF fonts (urw). These are the only fonts distributed
	  and ready to use. The limitation is that they don't have international
	  characters.

For best quality:

	- MS core fonts for the web. Will require download. see corefonts/README

	- MS Windows fonts that can be copied from a nearby windows partition.
	  See ms/README

Free solutions that may be distirbuted in the future:

	- lucida
	- liberation
	- vera

To do:
	- The Latin Modern family is *very* interesting but it's not easy
	  to understand which are the right files and what glyphs they contain
	  for use by the CSS model
		(sans, serif, mono)x(regular, bold, italic, bolditalic)
