This is a very simple PDF viewer application.  The core library
can load a PDF document and convert pages from it to PPM images.

However, PDF is a huge standard with thousands of features.
This small library tries to at least render text nicely but
there is still a lot to be done to achieve a perfectly drawn
document.  Some features can be implemented by looking at
xpdf; others are cans of worms.

Some missing stuff:
- Type3 fonts
- Other types of images (atm only JPEG is ok)
- correct path drawing operations, filling, clipping
  (a lot of common code with SVG)

For printing the correct approach is to convert the document
to Postscript and send it to the system's printer.

This program would've been rather impossible without the
sources of xpdf, which not only is a great program but
also is well written and easy to figure out.  Many thanks
and props to its author.
