WARNING
=======

pyc has not been tested besides bootstrapping itself and running
some simple benchmarks!
Please test before attempting to do anything serious with it.
Reports that it worked or it didn't are most welcome.



USAGE
=====

As a package:

	from pyc import compileFile
	compileFile ('file.py')

From pyc.py:

	python pyc.py [py-files]

But suppose you want to run a file pystone.py with pyc:

	python pyc.py -O3 --show-marks pystone.py
	python pystone.pyc	# <===== run the pyc file!!!

some times python recompiles files with its own compiler.
Executing the .pyc file is a sure way to avoid this.

'-O3' enables the best optimizations but be careful with
locals() since local variables may disappear!



PYTHON VERSION
==============

pyc can produce 2.4 and 2.3 bytecode


DEVELOPMENT
===========

If you change anything make sure to run test_bootstrap.py
You can also run test_libsize.py to see how many and which
optimizations happen while compiling the toplevel of the
python standard library. (output copied to garbage/)



CREDITS
=======

60% of pyc is from python's standard library compiler.
Many thanks to the folks who wrote it.
