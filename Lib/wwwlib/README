Browser of the web
------------------

Generally, a web browser that does all the things simple people
want (flash, advanced javascript and plugins) is not what this
is about. A js/flash engine may be implemented in the future
but replacing Mozilla is not something feasible.

For that this is a "browser of the web" and not a "web browser".
We don't care about showing a page 100% the way it should be;
instead, in every page there is some interesting data and the
wrapping css decoration. We try to make the interesting data
available to the user.

The CSS engine is currently broken (there are some serious bugs
in inline boxes with borders+box-decoration, as well as the
fact that inline flow and box flow should be separated. These
two things, together with many others can be fixed only with
a complete rewrite!).

The browser can switch between "full css mode" and "plain HTML
mode" by pressing '8' and '1'. Bugs that appear in full css
mode should not be reported; we can discover a million of
them easilly ourselfs:)
On the other hands, bugs that stop the plain HTML mode from
working *are* more important and should be fixed.

The bottom line is that there is a vast amount of content
on the internet. Some of this just works with this browser.
Most modern sites that are reworked with css kludges to
become part of the "Web 2.0 revolution" do not. MyFace,
SpaceBook, GoogleEarth, Gmail and Youtube are out of the
question. We are better off using the site's API directly
to write a custom frontend, or use sites like pwnyoutube.


notes
-----

- The browser does permanent www mirroring. IOW the webcache
is never cleaned and even has a structure that makes it
easy to explore.
