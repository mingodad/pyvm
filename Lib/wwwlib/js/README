Javascript
----------

So far we have only a lexer, useful for indenting js in bundles.

It's quite easy to write a javascript interpreter: parse the tokens
to an ast tree and then add an "eval()" method to each node.

Speed is not an issue.

The real hard part is interfacing with the HTML DOM (which is the
I/O system of the js language) and especially re-rendering parts
of the display if js code modifies css attributes of various nodes.
That will require a rewrite of the css rendering engine which is
in a broken state anyway!
