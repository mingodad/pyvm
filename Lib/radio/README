This radio player uses mms:// streams.

It hasn't been tested on a low speed connection. On the other hand, on
a high speed link with a bittorrent application running in parallel and
downloading at 800kB/s it works fine.

The problem now is, finding mms:// addresses for your favorite station.
There are some meta-sites that have such addresses for many stations.
Otoh, station's websites are usually written entirely in flash and in
this case discovering the mms url can be a big adventure. Open in www
and save Bundle, to explore.

It might make sense to distribute a DB of known mms stations.
