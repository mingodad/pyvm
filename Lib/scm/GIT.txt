This is a minimal implementation of git, basically useful for self-hosting
pyvm, getting updates and as an interesting testcase.  It can't do everything
standard git does.

On the other hand, it is possible to use standard git on the pyvm repo
and do things that this git can't do yet.

The "prorcelain" git commands are also a bit different. pyvm is a small
project which is supposed to have linear history and for that it doesn't
have the entire functionality of the official git, despite the fact
that getting there is not very difficult.

For instruction about using git with pyvm, see the file GIT.txt in
Doc/
