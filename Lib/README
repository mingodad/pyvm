Compilation
-----------

After the initial bootstrap, most files can be just edited and
they'll be re-compiled automatically when they are imported.

The exception is the files under pyc/ and some other *.py files.
If these are modified you'll have to run something like

	make rebuild

There are still some possibilities that the bootstrap will be
broken. In this case you'll need python (tested only with 2.4)
and run the script

	mkimage.sh

"Bootstrap broken":
 Suppose the file "posix.pyc" is deleted. In order to re-create
 it we'll need to run the pyc compiler; However, the pyc compiler
 tries to import this file and since it does not exist, it cannot
 run. This is a simple case of broken bootstrap.
 The command "make rebuild" creates a tarball of all the required
 "pycs" in bootstrap.bin so that we can be sure that they will
 not be accidentially deleted. However, suppose that we have modified
 the *API* of the posix.py module; in this case what we have in
 bootstrap.bin is not usable because it contains the old API.
 This is the "seriously" broken bootstrap and we will definitelly
 need Python 2.4 to generate posix.pyc which can be imported by
 the pyc compiler.
 At the moment, the mkimage.sh script runs the default "python"
 installation and if that isn't 2.4 you may not be able to
 recover from this situation and make the toolchain unusable
 until you've installed python 2.4. The other solution is to
 not modify the API of any *py files.
