Compilation
-----------

After the initial bootstrap, most files can be just edited and
they'll be re-compiled automatically when they are imported.

The exception is the files under pyc/ and some other *.py files.
If these are modified you'll have to run something like

	make rebuild

There are still some possibilities that the bootstrap will be
broken. In this case you'll need python (tested only with 2.4)
and run the script

	mkimage.sh
