A mail message must be created. One option is to select 'export reply'
from the mailnews reader. Then edit this file and finally:

	pyvm smtp -sendmail <file>

'pyvm smtp' is an interactive program that will ask if you really
want to send the mail, etc.

Outgoing mailservers should be listed in the file PYVM/user/mail/SMTP
like

	<user@isp.com> smtp.isp.com
	<jim@univ.edu> mailserver.univ.edu jim pa55w0rdz

Todo:
- attach files
- PGP sign messages
- spell checking
