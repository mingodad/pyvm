#
# we have a string and its length. the hash function can XOR
# characters from the start of the string, from the end and the length.
# the coefficients can be shifted.
# For example:
#	parameters: ((1,1),(-3,0),('l',2))
#  	is the hash function: str [1] >> 1 ^ str [len - 3] ^ len >> 2
#
# Our goal is to find the parameters that for a set of WORDS,
# - obviously generate a different value for each word
# - the values are as close as possible (no gap == perfect)
# - have a good offset (0 is the best but power of 2 is good)
# - it is cheap (few coefficients, zero shifts, no negative indexes)
#
# The program just prints the 'best' 50 with a crappy heuristic and let's
# us figure out more. (for example "str [1]>>2 ^ str [2]>>2" is
# "(str[1]^str[2])>>2" which is cheaper).
#
# For many words it is better to separate them in two subsets by length.
# For example if we want to find the perfect hash of C++'s reserved words
# small keywords ('and', 'or') limit our choices since length can be 0,1,-1,-2
# In this case it's better to make one set of words with length <= 3 and a
# second one with length > 3, find two perfect hashes for the two sets and
# divide the search.
