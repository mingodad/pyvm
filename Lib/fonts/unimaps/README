Codepage to unicode tables.

For newbies:
	Take for example a web page that is sent with charset=iso-8859-7.
	In this encoding, each byte is a glyph.  For instance a byte with
	value 243 is the greek letter SIGMA.  In the Universal Character
	Set which contains all the glyphs of the universe, the greek
	SIGMA has the value 963 (and obviously needs more bytes to
	represent).  These tables here can be used to convert some
	text in iso-8859-7 to a UTF-8 text.

Text + Codepage ==transcode==> UTF-8


The iso* files are taken from /usr/share/kbd/unimaps
The others downloaded from www.unicode.org and converted
