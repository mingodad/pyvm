There are two things in fonts:

1) Load font files (ttf, pfb, etc) and raster glyphs to grayscale
bitmaps for the requested px-size.

We can use freetype for that, or one of the builtin rasterizers
or if all else fails, go for PSF fonts.

2) Cache the bitmaps and render sentences on an RGB framebuffer (or
create glyph icons)

The renderer is based on PDF rederer (it's the same device) and
text looks pretty nice everywhere.
